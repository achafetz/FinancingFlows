####Official Development Assistance (ODA), Net Disbursement
*[Source: OECD QWIDS,] (http://stats.oecd.org/qwids/) DAC2A*	

Grants or loans to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients (developing countries) and to multilateral agencies which are: (a) undertaken by the official sector; (b) with promotion of economic development and welfare as the main objective; (c) at concessional financial terms (if a loan, having a grant element of at least 25 per cent). In addition to financial flows, technical co-operation is included in aid. Grants, loans and credits for military purposes are excluded. Transfer payments to private individuals (e.g. pensions, reparations or insurance payouts) are in general not counted. 

####Other Official Flows (OOF), Net (Assumed) Disbursement
*[Source: OECD QWIDS,] (http://stats.oecd.org/qwids/) DAC2b*

Transactions by the official sector with countries on the DAC List of ODA Recipients which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as Official Development Assistance, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they have a grant element of less than 25 per cent. 

####Private Flows, Net Disbursement
*[Source: OECD QWIDS,] (http://stats.oecd.org/qwids/) DAC4*

Consist of flows at market terms financed out of private sector resources (i.e. changes in holdings of private long-term assets held by residents of the reporting country) and private grants (i.e. grants by non-governmental organizations and other private bodies, net of subsidies received from the official sector).

In data presentations which focus on the outflow of funds from donors, private flows other than foreign direct investment are restricted to credits with a maturity of greater than one year and are usually divided into:
- Foreign direct investment: Investment made to acquire or add to a lasting interest in an enterprise in a country on the DAC List of ODA Recipients. "Lasting interest" implies a long-term relationship where the direct investor has a significant influence on the management of the enterprise, reflected by ownership of at least 10% of the shares, or equivalent voting power or other means of control. In practice, it is recorded as the change in the net worth of a subsidiary in a recipient country to the parent company, as shown in the books of the latter.
- Private export credits: See export credits.
- Securities of multilateral agencies: This covers the transactions of the private non-bank and bank sector in bonds, debentures, etc., issued by multilateral institutions.
- Bilateral portfolio investment and other: Includes bank lending and the purchase of shares, bonds and real estate.

####Personal remittances, received
*[Source: World Bank WDI] (http://data.worldbank.org/)*

Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and nonresident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by nonresident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees. Data are in current U.S. dollars. World Bank staff estimates based on IMF balance of payments data.

####Tax Revenue (Central Government)

Converted from National Currency to current USD using WDI period average exchange rates (US CPI: 2000 = 100)

Tax revenue refers to compulsory transfers to the central government for public purposes. Certain compulsory transfers such as fines, penalties, and most social security contributions are excluded. Refunds and corrections of erroneously collected tax revenue are treated as negative revenue.

#### Gross Domestic Product, GDP (current US$)  
*[Source: World Bank WDI] (http://data.worldbank.org/)*

GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used.

#### Gross Domestic Product Purchasing Power Parity, GDP PPP (current international $)  
*[Source: World Bank WDI] (http://data.worldbank.org/)*

PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current international dollars. For most economies PPP figures are extrapolated from the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) benchmark estimates or imputed using a statistical model based on the 2011 ICP. For 47 high- and upper middle-income economies conversion factors are provided by Eurostat and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

#### Population
*[Source: World Bank WDI] (http://data.worldbank.org/)*  
Total population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship--except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of their country of origin. The values shown are midyear estimates.

#### Least Developed Countries
*[Source: UNCTAD] (http://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx)*  
LDCs are low-income countries confronting severe structural impediments to sustainable development. There are currently 48 countries designated by the United Nations as least developed countries (LDCs). [Read more here.] (http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/cdp/ldc_info.shtml)
